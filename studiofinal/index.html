        <h1>Bird Migration patterns</h1>
        <p>
            Bird migration is the annual, large scale movement of birds from locations of lower food and nesting resources to locations with higher resources. Bird migration is important to study because it gives us insights on bird movements, their behavior, and relevant concepts such as bird evolution, climate change, habitat, and species conservation. Bird migration charts are tools to visualize these complex bird movements across the globe which are relevant for scientific as well as general public consumption. Collecting data to create these visualizations is difficult and is done by using different methods like bird ringing, counting, radio and satellite tracking, geo-logging, radar tracking. The data collection method used has an impact on how the bird migration chart is visualized. This report summarizes current state-of-the-art tools used for the data collection on bird migration and the visualization tools that support the discovery and advancement of the field.
            <br><br>
            There are 4 different flyways in North America which most of the birds migration patterns are clasiffied into. <br>
            <b>The Central Flyway • The Atlantic Flyway • The Mississippi Flyway • The Pacific Flyway</b>
            <br><br>
            Scientists use several techniques in studying migration, including banding, satellite tracking, and a relatively new method involving lightweight devices known as geolocators. One of the goals is to locate important stopover and wintering locations. Once identified, steps can be taken to protect and save these key locations.
            <br>
            Birds generally travel in loops year-round, the general case is birds move to <b>northern regions in summers and southern regions in winters.</b>

                <h4>Pelecanus occidentalis</h4>
                <p>The Brown Pelican is a comically elegant bird with an oversized bill, sinuous neck, and big, dark body. Squadrons glide above the surf along southern and western coasts, rising and falling in a graceful echo of the waves.
                    <br> <br>
                    It uses the <b>The Atlantic Flyway</b>.
                    Many Atlantic populations disperse northward in the summer after breeding and return southward in autumn, probably to follow concentrations of fish.

                <p>Black-bellied Plovers are a dazzling mix of snow white and jet black, accented by checkerboard wings. They are supreme aerialists, both agile and swift. 
                    <br> <br>
                    It uses the <b>The Atlantic Flyway</b>.
                    Black-bellied Plovers are vocal and conspicuous, relatively easily found on beaches and coastal wetlands of all coasts of North America. Look for them on tidal mudflats anytime except high tide.

                    Starting in late August and September, nearly the whole population of Swainson’s Hawks migrates from North America to Argentina, a roundtrip of more than 12,000 miles for the northernmost breeders.

        <p><b>Bird Migration visualizations</b> are of importance to the scientific community as well as for general public consumption. They help to visualize complex patterns of bird movements across the world which can have an impact on various fields such as conservation, climate change studies.
            <br><br>
            Bird migration charts capture the attention of expert ornithologists and common citizens alike. They have been a great source of knowledge on various applied fields like climate change, habitat conservations, bird conservation to name a few. There are efforts to combine the power of technology and the manpower of citizens to work towards providing a conducive environment for counting birds as they take up perilous migrations. Audubon and Bird Cast, by the Cornell Lab are two such communities. Bird Cast is a project which combines the might of the Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) along with volunteering bird watchers to keep a track of a database of bird data
            <br><br>
            One of the primary reasons why bird migration is important is because of its impact on many related fields like climate change, bird conservation, habitat studies, and policymaking to name a few. Interestingly this rather interesting and important phenomenon was not visualized for a long time in history. This was because collecting bird data is a rather difficult task and scientific methods are only a century old. There are multiple methods but they all come with their limitations. There is a need to coordinate internationally with various agencies. It is thus also important to have enough bird literate citizens who can lend a helping hand in various bird census efforts.
